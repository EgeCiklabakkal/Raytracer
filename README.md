# Raytracer
Raytracer developed throughout the course CENG795 - Advanced Ray Tracing  

During development, I have followed the book [Peter Shirley and R. Keith Morley. 2003. Realistic Ray Tracing (2 ed.). A. K. Peters, Ltd., Natick, MA, USA.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=940410) very closely and parts of the code are identical as well.

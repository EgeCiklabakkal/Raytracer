# Raytracer
Raytracer developed throughout the course CENG795 - Advanced Ray Tracing  

During development, I have followed the book [Shirley, Peter. (2000). Realistic Ray Tracing. 10.1201/9781439864449](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=940410) very closely and parts of the code are identical as well.

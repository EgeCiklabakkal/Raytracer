# Raytracer
Raytracer developed throughout the course CENG795 - Advanced Ray Tracing  

During development, I have followed the book [Peter Shirley and R. Keith Morley. 2003. Realistic Ray Tracing (2 ed.). A. K. Peters, Ltd., Natick, MA, USA.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=940410) very closely and parts of the code are identical as well.

Raytracer supports BVH, distributed ray tracing (depth of field, area lights and soft shadows, glossy reflections, motion blur), texture mapping, bump mapping, HDR rendering and global illimunation by path tracing and progressive photon mapping.

You can find the development blog [here](https://raytracerdev.blogspot.com/).

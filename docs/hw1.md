HW1

- In this assignment you are expected to implement a basic ray tracer that supports ray-triangle and ray-sphere intersections with a simple perspective camera model and several shading models. These include diffuse shading, specular (Blinn-Phong) shading, ambient shading, ideal specular (mirror) reflectance, and dielectrics (transparency).

- The inputs to your program will be custom XML files that define the camera and scene properties. The XML files are generally self-explanatory but you can ask in the forum in case of confusion.

- You are expected to submit your homework as a single compressed file (.zip or .tar.gz) and share your results in a custom blog page that you will create. Please share your experiences in this blog page. You can include timings, the difficulties you encountered and how you solved them, even results of failed renderings. Posting only images without discussions is not desired.
